# Welcome

welcome to Marketplace Kit for TailwindCSS framework. a collection of ready components to build a marketplace/shop/e-commerce website.

the TMK get better every day. as a rule of thumb we try to build components with pure HTML/JS/Tailwind syntax, 
but sometimes for specific functionalities, like state management, we have to use some framework features.

## Goal

the goal is making it easy and fast to re-use components between front-end frameworks. 
we create a component with Html + tailwindcss. then, we use it as Nuxt/Angular/React component.

80% HTML/JS/Tailwind and 20% front-end framework features to make it reusable everywhere.
